# Student Data Analysis

## Overview

This project is a simple Python program to analyze student data using **Pandas** and **NumPy**. It reads student information from a CSV file and provides statistics, grades, and filtering options.

## Features

* Display student data from CSV
* Calculate average, highest, and lowest marks
* Display student(s) with highest and lowest marks
* Assign grades based on marks
* Filter high-performing students (marks > 75)
* Sort students by marks
* Menu-driven for user interaction

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install required libraries:

   ```
   pip install pandas numpy
   ```
3. Place `students.csv` in the same directory as the script.
4. Run the program:

   ```
   python student_data_analysis.py
   ```
5. Follow the menu to explore student data.

## CSV File Format

The CSV file should have the following columns:

```
ID,Name,Marks

```

## Project Purpose

* Learn to use **Pandas and NumPy** for data analysis.
* Practice handling CSV files and implementing basic statistics.
* Build a menu-driven Python program to interact with user input.
